For an unknown reason, they felt weirdly drawn to the lights.",

As the pigs entered, fear began to shoot through the bodies as they saw the restraints on tables and the experimental equipment. It was too late for them, they could no longer stop it and go back. No one could have ever imagined what would happen to the pigs on that ship..."

It would seem that humanity -- tripping off its disposition, has now adopted the mentality of apes. Whereas the society of apes mirrors the modern world of humanity.

They had fled their lands during the massive flood and since then the tribe was searching for a new home. However, on the first day of the new year, one of the Void Angels got a message from The Shaman, saying he was waiting for them to come and live on The Island.  The Void Angel announced the big news to everyone and the ship sailed right to The Island.",
            "This was a big day for The Island as well. The Shaman gathered every islander and they all went to the beach. They set a big fire and around it formed a giant drum circle. One of the Islanders, IlluminatiCongo stood up, walked to the fire and began to chant in ancient words. Some other free sprits jumped to their toes and started dancing. They all got united in a single groove and right at the moment they all synchronized, the giant ship appeared on the horizon.",
            "The Islanders danced until the ship had arrived. And when The Shamanic Tribe landed on the beach, they all joined the groove and the party went on for seven days and seven nights."

            "It had been 7 long months at sea on a giant ship for The Lost Shamanic Tribe of the Old World. They had fled their lands during the massive flood and since then the tribe was searching for a new home. However, on the first day of the new year, one of the Void Angels got a message from The Shaman, saying he was waiting for them to come and live on The Island.  The Void Angel announced the big news to everyone and the ship sailed right to The Island.",
            "This was a big day for The Island as well. The Shaman gathered every islander and they all went to the beach. They set a big fire and around it formed a giant drum circle. One of the Islanders, IlluminatiCongo stood up, walked to the fire and began to chant in ancient words. Some other free sprits jumped to their toes and started dancing. They all got united in a single groove and right at the moment they all synchronized, the giant ship appeared on the horizon.",
            "The Islanders danced until the ship had arrived. And when The Shamanic Tribe landed on the beach, they all joined the groove and the party went on for seven days and seven nights."
